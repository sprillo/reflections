When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people might be working on the same remote. Automatically updating the remote can cause severe conflicts.
