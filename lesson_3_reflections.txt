When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people might be working on the same remote. Automatically updating the remote can cause severe conflicts.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork operates only on repositories. It is used to copy a public repository into your GitHub repositories.
Branch operates on a local branch. It is used for example to develop new features without modifying the original project.
Clone copies a complete repository from GitHub into your local workspace, or from a local workspace into to the local workspace. It is used for that simple reason.
